#NewsHub
NewsHub is built using class-based components using Reactjs.

The link 'https://vishalsetty11.github.io/NewsHub/' would show 'Error 404' beacuse we have used 'react-router-dom' and git dosn't support router-dom.

So, I have hosted NewsHub on 'https://newshub-reactjs.vercel.app' using Vercel.

NewHub cannot be opened on the bower as newsAPI provides developer API for localhost.
{

      "status": "error",
      "code": "corsNotAllowed",
      "message": "Requests from the browser are not allowed on the Developer plan, except from localhost."

}
